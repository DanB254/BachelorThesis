I2C/SPI bus to be able connect more modules in the future
Standardized connector to just connect every device in the tester (dont need to worry about how to connect TP)
MUX for switching JLINK port on device 
Externally ADC for measurement 
possibility to connect multimeter to calibrate tester measurement
Relays/Transistors/OC array for switching signals 
Programmable gain of inputs ? 
Temperature/Humidity sensor for calibration 
Able to have some GPIO to be configured in the future
